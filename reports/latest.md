# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-23T15:45:34.000Z

Hot tier: 40 MB of 57 MB (0.0567 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 40 MB within 2 hours, with 0 MB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 3 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 38 MB in 11 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 0 MB in 1.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 0.2 hours (rollover max_age 3m + a median 7 minutes from rollover to mount over 73 moved indices).
- Each counted byte takes 1.02 bytes of store kept, 1.02 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 438 MB a day, under the 635 MB a day that fits the size; every statement keeps its lines, with room to grow 1.5 times.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 115 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
