# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-25T05:12:25.000Z

Hot tier: 4 MB of 56 MB (0.056 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 56 MB within 2 hours, with 602 MB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 0 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 4 MB in 1 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 0 MB in 0 on hot, 1 MB in 1 off hot, outside the size.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); the tier_down write index is off hot, so moved lines take no room on hot while they wait for their mount.
- Each counted byte takes 0.96 bytes of store kept, 0.96 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 1.3 GB a day; 702 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 11 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 434 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Warning: 1 documents on hot carry no utf8Size, so their statements count as 0 bytes. The Receiver writes it when installed for the hot-tier run.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
