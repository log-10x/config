# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-24T20:48:18.000Z

Hot tier: 4 MB of 74 MB (0.0742 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 176 MB within 2 hours, with 274 MB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 0 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 4 MB in 1 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 0 MB in 1.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 2 hours (default (no tier_down index has been moved yet)).
- Each counted byte takes 2.34 bytes of store kept, 2.34 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 902 MB a day; 106 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 0 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 628 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Warning: 1 documents on hot carry no utf8Size, so their statements count as 0 bytes. The Receiver writes it when installed for the hot-tier run.
- Warning: The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) alone keeps about 628 MB a day on hot, more than the 106 MB a day that fits, so hot settles above 74 MB at about 176 MB. Raise the size, move the noisiest services to offload, or lower the sample.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
