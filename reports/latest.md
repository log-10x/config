# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-25T08:33:51.000Z

Hot tier: 64 MB of 63 MB (0.063 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 62 MB within 2 hours, with 3.5 GB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 1 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 62 MB in 11 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 0 MB in 0 on hot, 20 MB in 2 off hot, outside the size.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); the tier_down write index is off hot, so moved lines take no room on hot while they wait for their mount.
- Each counted byte takes 0.89 bytes of store kept, 0.89 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 4.3 GB a day; 817 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 29 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 142 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Hot is above the size now; the allowance is held at 99% until it drains, which takes up to 2 hours as the indices on hot age out.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
