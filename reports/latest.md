# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-23T05:01:14.000Z

Hot tier: 46 MB of 45 MB (0.0448 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 45 MB within 6 hours, with 841 MB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 1 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 30 MB in 5 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 15 MB in 3.
- A kept line stays on hot 6 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 1h + frozen min_age 5h)); a tier_down index 2 hours (default (no tier_down index has been moved yet)).
- Each counted byte takes 0.98 bytes of store kept, 0.58 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 853 MB a day; 11 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 0 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- Hot is above the size now; the allowance is held at 97% until it drains, which takes up to 6 hours as the indices on hot age out.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
