# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-23T14:25:37.000Z

Hot tier: 66 MB of 57 MB (0.0567 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 51 MB within 2 hours, with 3.6 GB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 3 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 52 MB in 11 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 11 MB in 3.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 0.2 hours (rollover max_age 3m + a median 7 minutes from rollover to mount over 49 moved indices).
- Each counted byte takes 0.94 bytes of store kept, 0.62 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 4 GB a day; 434 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 13 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 104 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Hot is above the size now; the allowance is held at 86% until it drains, which takes up to 2 hours as the indices on hot age out.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
