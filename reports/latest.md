# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-24T21:03:14.000Z

Hot tier: 12 MB of 74 MB (0.0742 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 74 MB within 2 hours, with 2.3 GB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 0 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 4 MB in 2 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 8 MB in 1.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 0.3 hours (rollover max_age 10m + a median 7 minutes from rollover to mount over 1 moved indices).
- Each counted byte takes 1.47 bytes of store kept, 0.57 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 2.7 GB a day; 483 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 13 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 168 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Warning: 1 documents on hot carry no utf8Size, so their statements count as 0 bytes. The Receiver writes it when installed for the hot-tier run.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
