# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-24T20:59:16.000Z

Hot tier: 15 MB of 74 MB (0.0742 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 124 MB within 2 hours, with 1.4 GB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 0 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 3 MB in 2 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 11 MB in 2.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 2 hours (default (no tier_down index has been moved yet)).
- Each counted byte takes 1.35 bytes of store kept, 0.87 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 1.6 GB a day; 0 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 0 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 200 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Warning: 1 documents on hot carry no utf8Size, so their statements count as 0 bytes. The Receiver writes it when installed for the hot-tier run.
- Warning: The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) alone keeps about 200 MB a day on hot, more than the 0 MB a day that fits, so hot settles above 74 MB at about 124 MB. Raise the size, move the noisiest services to offload, or lower the sample.
- Warning: Lines outside the Receiver and the tier_down lines waiting to move already fill 74 MB, so the Receiver's services keep nothing beyond the always-pass sample of 5 lines a statement a window.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
