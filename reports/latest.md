# Hot-tier run: 2026-10-25T00:12:48.000Z

Hot tier: 73 MB of 63 MB (0.063 GB set in the policy) on 1 hot node; at these limits it settles at about 57 MB within 2 hours, with 2.6 GB a day of counted lines moved to the frozen tier.

- Outside the Receiver: 1 MB on hot. The Receiver's kept lines: 58 MB in 11 indices; its tier_down lines not yet moved: 14 MB in 2.
- A kept line stays on hot 2 hours (ILM policy tenx-keep (rollover max_age 10m + frozen min_age 110m)); a tier_down index 0.3 hours (rollover max_age 10m + a median 7 minutes from rollover to mount over 14 moved indices).
- Each counted byte takes 0.88 bytes of store kept, 0.48 as tier_down (measured on the indices on hot).
- The Receiver's statements send 3.2 GB a day; 565 MB a day fits the size, so each statement keeps up to 17 MB a day and the noisiest give way first.
- The always-pass sample (5 lines a statement a window on every node, 50 more for an error statement over its limit) keeps about 145 MB a day on hot whatever the limits; the size holds down to that floor.
- Hot is above the size now; the allowance is held at 87% until it drains, which takes up to 2 hours as the indices on hot age out.

Limits and totals are bytes per 4-minute window per node, counted the way the Receiver counts them (utf8Size). Error lines pass 50 over a limit per statement per node per window.
